# CatFeeder

This repository contains all source code from my pet project.
This project is composed of many DIY elements :
 - The cat feeder itself, essentially made of woods and plastic
 - Electronics (micro controllers, servo, sensors, ...), with home made circuits and PCB
 - Microcontroller development (Atmel 8 bits)
 - Hybrid mobile app to control micro controllers (Cordova, Ionic2, Angular2)
